Still in the works, not a completed script.

Used to track out of office events.

Maximum Persons out of the office at one time is set by admin

Background: small team that works in a cyclical busy pattern. During slow season 2 people can be out of office per day. During busy season only 1 person can be out. However, there are exceptions. The purpose of this Scheduler is to allow team members to sign up for days off(vacation, work travel, training, etc.) The Scheduler app should check the existing reserved dates for compliance. If there are existing reserved dates the Scheduler app should decide if this is a pass or fail according to the maximum out per day set by the Admin./n
There are 3 tabs.

Tab1 - Form to request time off

Tab2 - display existing requests

Tab3 - Admin to add additional team members and remove old team members

To-do

1. Add a tab showing a calendar with a sum of people out per day.
